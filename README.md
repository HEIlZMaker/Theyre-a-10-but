This is a git practice project 
The way you play this game might change as time goes on, I do want to put this on the web later, but the way it currently works is that you just hit a button that isn't q to get another question
you're then suppose to ask your friend they're a 10(can be another number than 10) but (the question) I forgot to add the thing that says a number, I might eventually figure out a good way to implement that along 
with an actual fake random that makes the question feel more varied than current implementations are
for now its probably better to make up your own number
