This is a git practice project 
The way you play this game might change as time goes on, I do want to put this on the web later, but the way it currently works is that you just hit a button that isn't q to get another question
you're then suppose to ask your friend they're a 10 but <insert your own number> I forgot to add the thing that says a number, I might eventually figure out a good way to implement that along 
with an actual fake random that makes the question feel more varied than current implementations are
